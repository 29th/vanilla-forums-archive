I'd bring it over here, basically you just rate the track the person 
above you is listening to on a 1-10 scale and explain your reasoning if 
you like then post your own song."<br /><br />The rules:<br /><ol><li>You must post artist name and track name.</li><li>You must provide a URL to listen to the track (YouTube, MySpace, etc).</li><li>You cannot rate your own tracks.</li><li>And of course no extremely negative comments if you don't like a persons song.</li></ol><p>I'll go first:</p><br />Live - Dolphins Cry<br />https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBHmcORu4og<br />]]>

        <description><![CDATA[<p>I remember a legend.</p>

<p>Back in the olden days, when Darkest Hour was played<br />
you'd be shot in the head, four houndred meters away.</p>

<p>A glimpse of the soldier was to be catched,<br />
as he crouch-shot your head, unable to be snatched.</p>

<p>You'd fear his presence, but admire his skill,<br />
because there where no player alike, that he couldnt kill.</p>

<p>Mikael, where are you? My dear Finnish friend.<br />
We stopped hearing from you, where'd you go in the end?</p>

<p>Your old War-Pig, Dahlen.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[<p>Hello there brothers in arms. My name is Pvt. Dracocardos. I was a member of the 29th briefly back in 2016 although back then I was called Pvt. Drake. This time around I decided to use my real name as I have seen at least one other Drake already in the 29th and I wanted to avoid possible confusion.</p>

<p>Anyway, last time I was a member there were a few problems. Firstly there was an issue with my mic setup and my voice was always heard doubled and there were a few issues with me not being able to do certain things due to incorrect setup of certain key bindings.</p>

<p>I was wondering if there is anyone who would be willing to join me on an Arma 3 server before BCT starts this evening just to run me through the most used key bindings that I will need and also to comment on whether my mic comes across correctly in game so that I can sort out any issues before we start. I don't want to be that guy who cuts into our BCT time while I am trying to sort out game configurations during BCT.</p>

<p>Any takers?</p>

        <description><![CDATA[<p>Hello everyone new and old that is still around. I peeped through some areas to see where I should ease my way back into a community that has a foundation that will never crumble. I played in back the days of DOD as we transition to DH, Where should I join back in and where is everyone the most active so I can get my feet wet. Cheers old friends and cheers to the possible new ones.</p>

In order for this event to take place though, I need to be able to get in contact with a member of your community that is in charge or could liaison for you in this event. I've had a little difficultly to get in contact with y'all between the forums and passworded teamspeak, so hopefully someone sees this.</p>

        <title>What Headset Do You Use?</title>

        <description><![CDATA[<p>While I was placing an order down for a new headset to replace the one I'm wearing now, I suddenly became curious about what kind of headsets does everyone else use at this current moment? The one I'm currently wearing right now is a Logitech Stereo Headset H250 Graphite which has done quite well in the past year I've had it but at the moment I've been getting annoyed with the sound quality in it and the fact it seems to blast out with echoes from whatever I'm doing down the microphone. If you want a price on this model it cost me about £15.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.tohome.com/images/imageproduct/210/28062013/H250-BK-1.jpg" alt="enter image description here" title="enter image title here" /></p>

<p>So now I've upgraded myself after asking a few mates over Facebook who I did IT with about what the next one I should get is and they gave me this: <br />
<img src="http://www.datacity.dk/120833-home_default/steelseries-siberia-v2-black-full-size-headset.jpg" alt="enter image description here" title="enter image title here" /></p>

<p>Apparently it suited them quite well and the colour is something I like since it matches all the other items on my desk. This model is a SteelSeries Siberia V2 FullSize Headset. Cost me another £50 getting this thing but hopefully the sound quality from both my microphone and headset will be a lot better!</p>

After all, these so called benefits are only meant to HELP, but not completely remove one's issues. However, I'd like to hear your guys' thoughts on this topic of health benefits provided from the trees.</p>
