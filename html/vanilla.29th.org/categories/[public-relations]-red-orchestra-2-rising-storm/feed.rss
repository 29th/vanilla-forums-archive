        <description><![CDATA[<p>Hello everyone!! I'm posting here today to invite you all (and any prospective members you may have) to come join us to play in our pick up game nights!</p>

<p>We host these at [b]Friday 8:00PM EST![/b]</p>

<p>These weekly recurring events generally consist of TE, SU, Skirmish game-modes, vanilla and custom maps. We allow clans to have priority slots over individuals. As in, if you even have a half squad of guys we will fit you in there.</p>

<p>The platform we use is Discord ( <a href="https://discord.gg/9qYXBB3" rel="nofollow">https://discord.gg/9qYXBB3</a> ) I am not aware of what medium you guys use. Although, you may use whichever as your team's medium, but I ask that under the event that you do decide to participate in the event, we require at least a liaison to come into the Discord to let us know things are a go.</p>

<p>My steam name: pr0n`discoBiscuit-<br />
Our forums: <a href="http://pr0nst4r.com/forums/" rel="nofollow">http://pr0nst4r.com/forums/</a></p>

<p>We hope to see you guys organize and participate!!</p>

<p><strong>Greetings,</strong></p>

<p><strong>We are the</strong> <u><strong>29th Infantry Division</strong></u>, <strong>a realism unit with the goal of creating a professional, disciplined and enjoyable atmosphere for its members and guests. This atmosphere ignites camaraderie as soldiers fight side by side on the battlefield, while bringing out the best of each other to achieve unthinkable goals. Our structure consists of three companies in which each plays a respective game » Rising Storm, Darkest Hour '44 and Arma 3.</strong></p>

<p><strong>This thread is directed to groups who play the game Red Orchestra 2 / Rising Storm. We host various events and scrimmages to give soldiers the chance to prove themselves in a battle against other groups and to provide an enjoyable time with each other. The</strong> <u><strong>Signal Corps</strong></u> <strong>is interested in creating a connection with groups wanting to participate in friendly competitions with us. We, therefore, challenge you to fight us on the battlefield!</strong></p>

<p><i><strong>If you are interested, please add one of the following Signal Corps members on steam to get more information about us. Hopefully we can create a connection where we can achieve something beautiful together:</strong></i></p>

        <description><![CDATA[<p>Hello, 29th ID!</p>

<p>I'm an organizer from the NA BloodBath Scrimz group.  Some of your members have come out on occasion to join in on our BloodBath Thursdays for CD and S&amp;D games.  But I've come on here to send out a general invitation because for the next upcoming event we're looking for more community participation.</p>

<p>BB Scrimz is relaunching its former [Country Wars] series where NA players will be pitted against players from other nations in large-scale battles of 20v20 or more.  It's all good fun and not seriously competitive, but it's a wonderful opportunity for making new international friends and cultural exchange; something that not a lot of NA players get much exposure to.</p>

<p>And much like how our community BloodBath nights go, our group in the Country War battle is expected to be just as diverse, being a coalition of clan and community players alike.  Our opponents will be in the same situation in that regard too.</p>

<p>Our upcoming inaugural match will be against Japan and is planned to be this coming Saturday morning at 10AM EST.  It's a public event so all are welcome to join.</p>

<p>If anyone is interested in more details they can feel free to add me on <a rel="nofollow" href="http://steamcommunity.com/id/BloodMalice/"><strong>Steam</strong></a> and join our <a rel="nofollow" href="http://steamcommunity.com/groups/RO2BLOODBATHSCRIMZ"><strong>Steam Group</strong></a>.</p>

<p>Thanks and take care, guys!</p>

<p><em>Salute</em><br />
BloodMalice</p>
