<p><br /><br />
</p><div style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/oglUZmU.png" alt="image" /></div>

<p><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: Verdana;">I had been working in Signal Corps searching around the Squad community for scrim opponents for about a year, and from day one, I hoped we could arrange a scrim with the SquadOps community. They are by far the longest standing one-life group in Squad besides the 29th, so I saw them as our best chance for a real tough fight. Sadly, I was unable to get anything to come to fruition with them. Fast forward a year later and a few scrims down the line, and Sgt. Furie was able to secure this scrim with them with relative ease. Once I heard the news that EP4 would finally have our scrim and it would be against what I perceived as the toughest challenge out there, and on my favorite map of Gorodok no less, I was pretty ecstatic. The scenario itself reminded me somewhat of the EP3 scenario with large portions of the map open to the defenders as well as a lot of foliage and small villages for the attackers to contend with.<br />
<br /><br />
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/9lghkwh.png" width="45%" alt="image" style="float: right; margin-left: 50px; margin-right: 50px; margin-top: 30px; margin-bottom: 30px;" /><br />
<span style="font-size: medium; font-family: Verdana;">The infamous month of scrim prep began shortly after the announcement was made to the company, and EP4 got right to work on picking the area apart and coming up with a plan to overcome the river crossing as well as how to best approach the objectives in the double bunkers area. Initially, we probed each approach individually to see the merits and downfalls of each one. We quickly came to the realization that the north, west, and direct south approaches took us deep into enemy territory where we could get surrounded as the round went on due the forests and hills in those locations giving the defenders plentiful amounts of concealment. This is something EP3 had to deal with as well in their scrim, which they did successfully by taking an approach that eliminated as much unseeable, or untraversable area for the defenders as possible.<br />
<br /><br />
<span style="font-size: medium; font-family: Verdana;">In order for EP4 to implement a similar idea, 2Lt. Dahl and I decided to try and use the large river, marking the movement restrictions for the defenders, as a way to protect our flanks through much of our approach. By attacking from the east and southeast, we were able to protect our sides and rear for much of the round until we approached the objective itself. In our preparation, this plan immediately showed more promise than the other approaches as we could force our enemy to fight us head on. However, as the weeks progressed and our plan became more concrete, we began to run into issues as the opfor 29th members we were practicing against began to find ways to challenge and counter our plan. Initially, this was a benefit as we could see what our plan’s weaknesses were. A few changes needed to be made in order to get around these weaknesses and they were implemented pretty successfully. The first major change came from T/5 Perez-Pantoja, who discovered a wonderful location for the Bradley to fire upon the two northern objectives from a cliff on the NE on our side of the river. This worked beautifully and it meant that we only had to destroy the 2 southern objectives by hand. The second biggest change was that EP4S3 needed to be sent across the river a bit early in the north to clear out a cliffside that looked down the length of the river that the rest of our team needed to cross. Once again, opfor began to find ways to challenge these changes and make our life difficult, which ended up being a double edged sword. With us being mostly satisfied with our attack plan, we began to work on our defense.<br />
<br /><br />

<p></p><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">River on Gorodok<br />
 </span></div>

<p><br /><br />
<span style="font-size: medium; font-family: Verdana;">We knew our defense wouldn’t be nearly as challenging, as the area was favorable to the defenders thanks to the large area, thick forests, and hilly/village terrains available to us. A 360 degree initial setup with some quick movements in response to contact is all we needed to keep the objectives reliably safe. S1 and S3 defended the SE and NE respectively to hold off any direct attacks, while S2 spread out across the entirety of our NW, W, and SW sides to scout and cover and potential long flanks the enemy may have tried. In our preparation this worked out very well as the squads were spread out just enough to cover all approaches, but also close enough together to move and respond to support each other if one squad began to get overwhelmed. With our plans in hand, we readied ourselves for gameday.<br />
<br /><br />
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/sYKofaT.png" width="55%" alt="image" style="float: left; margin-left: 50px; margin-right: 50px; margin-top: 30px; margin-bottom: 30px;" /><br />
<span style="font-size: medium; font-family: Verdana;">On the day of the scrim, we had some last minute replacements that needed to be called in for S3 to fill out some numbers- thankfully we had Sgt. Mortem, Sgt. Gibson, and PFC Logan on hand to do so. PFC Logan especially would come in very handy for the match itself and all three were a welcome addition to the team. Once that was all settled and the match began, we attacked first as is normally the order of things during 29th scrims. This is where the double edged sword of our preparation began to come into play. Squad Ops has a very different play style to the 29th, and although our rough preparation had gotten us to iron out any kinks or challenges we may face in our path, it took our attention away from the rest of the map on the enemy side of the river. Once we arrived at our staging area on our side of the river and the Bradley began shelling it’s objectives, I took a Kornet missile to the face from the enemy BMP while sitting in my command MRAP from a position on the far north side of the map that none of us thought to use in our preparation. This was quite an embarrassing and shocking moment for me personally, but 2Lt. Dahl did a good job of continuing to keep the team’s morale up and progress with the plan. However, The enemy BMP was not done us. After our Bradley destroyed the north objectives as planned, the BMP relocated to the bottom of the cliff that overlooked the river crossing. Nobody saw the BMP before it began to fire, and as a result S1 lost several players during the crossing before our Bradley was able to quickly dispatch the BMP. The team soldiered on and all squads took their initial areas as planned. This is where our lack of diversity in our preparation bit us again. We paused in our push as we normally did to eliminate any remaining contacts in our direct path, as our enemy was usually stacked there. However, Squad Ops had dispersed themselves far and wide on their side of the river and unbeknownst to us our path to the objectives was actually quite open if we had just taken it. This lead to us giving the enemy a chance to reinforce the objective and get behind us as we made our final push, ultimately resulting in our defeat.<br />
<br /><br />
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/DarpPjb.png" width="55%" alt="image" style="float: right; margin-left: 50px; margin-right: 50px; margin-top: 30px; margin-bottom: 30px;" /><br />
<span style="font-size: medium; font-family: Verdana;">Morale was definitely low after that. Murphy’s Law had come into effect hard and everything that could’ve gone wrong, did. Nonetheless, EP4 showed its heart and determination and everyone collectively decided one thing after we collected ourselves for the next round: We are going to win this round. The squads took their places and awaited the enemy. S3 and parts of S2 took contact first on the south side as a much of the enemy team came from there, while one squad attempted to attack from the direct north. T/5 Evarts and T/5 Perez Pantoja had other ideas though as the two of them stopped the southern attack in its tracks and forced Squad Ops to back off after taking several casualties with none inflicted in return. The T/5 duo began to pressure the enemy and follow them back as they moved east and thinning their numbers even further. Simultaneously, PFC Logan encountered the enemy on the north side and landed a frag rocket on the enemy TL very early in the round. This also encouraged the enemy to break off of their initial attack direction and attempt another push from the northwest. Logan would continue to find enemies to land frag rockets on before eventually being overrun at his position. Between the three of them, these players managed to end up killing about half the enemy and stop their initial pushes. This caused them to not have the strength necessary to really make a dent in any of our held positions and the rest of the team was able to prevent the enemy from even getting close to our bunkers housing the objectives.<br />
<br /><br />
<span style="font-size: medium; font-family: Verdana;">It was unfortunate that EP4 ended up being the first Easy Co. platoon to really drop a round against an enemy unit during a scrim, however there were some silver linings and lessons to be learned from the experience. EP4 showed its ability to take a difficult round on the chin and come back stronger as well as to outperform the enemy in terms of who had the stronger defense, and who made the most progress on their attack. Lessons were also learned for how to prepare next time to really keep our eyes open to all sorts of possible strategies from the enemy team, as the way Easy Co. plays Squad is not necessarily the only way to play Squad well. We also learned to believe in our plan a bit more and to not hesitate when we have the upper hand in the future. All in all the scrim was a mixed bag of course as a draw is not an ideal result with the enemy. However, EP4 did come out on top in terms of overall performance during each round comparatively speaking and we learned valuable lessons for the future. I am proud of fourth platoon and I look forward to seeing what we can accomplish on our next outing. Squad Ops were worthy opponents and they were a pleasure to interact with on and off of the battlefield. Hopefully we will get a chance to run it back against them in particular, and show them what we have learned.</span></span></span></span></p>
