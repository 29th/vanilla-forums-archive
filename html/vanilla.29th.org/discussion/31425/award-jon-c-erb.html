                    <p>As part of a group of 29th members called to assist in a fight with our friends the <em>2nd Marine Raider Battalion</em>, T4 Erb distinguished himself in his actions and performed his duties with exemplary skill and bravery.</p>

<blockquote><b>SSgt. Halls said:</b><br />On Sunday March 3rd, Charlie Company was deployed on a multi-unit operation.<br />
<br />
Upon reaching the base of the Hill 127, Coalition Forces met stiff resistance from both infantry, an enemy helicopter, and a Main Battle Tank. 
 Without adequate AT and the enemy controlling the sky we could only sit and watch as the tank shelled us to oblivion. The only hope we had at that point was a SINGLE satchel charge, carried by T4 Jon C. Erb. Despite all odds, he was able to protect our only AT asset and do what Combat Engineers do best – blow stuff up.<br />
<br />
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSiDTm3KGos">His actions</a> went above and beyond the call of duty – ensuring the capture of Hill 127 and giving the Coalition Force a brief window of opportunity for success.  Not only was this act of heroism noticed by the members of the 29th, but reaped praise from all present. To quote Cpt. Dreek of the 2MRB, <blockquote>"…that was probably one of the best plays of the campaign."</blockquote></blockquote>

<p><br /></p>

<p>Charlie Company HQ along with Battalion HQ are proud to award T4 Jon C. Erb the Army Commendation Medal for exemplary courage and skill under fire.  Congratulations T4!</p>

Letter of Recommendation from 2MRB<br />
<div class="Spoiler"><br />
Letter of Recommendation<br />
2nd Marine Raider Battalion<br />
Callsign “Tyrant”<br />
Records: 2nd Marine Raider Battalion "Tyrant"<br />
From: Captain Arlie Dreek<br />
Position: Team Leader<br />
<br /><br />
In light of the events during the recent battle of the ATC #9 campaign the Headquarters Staff of the 2nd Marine Raider Battalion wish to recommend an award of achievement be considered for a member of the 29th Infantry Division.

<p>The Headquarters Staff have deemed the actions of T/4 Jon C. Erb, Charlie Company, 1st Battalion, 29th Infantry Division as going above and beyond the call and proving to be a crucial necessity ensuring the capture of Hill 127, north of the village of Chalkeia (Objective C) on Altis. T/4 Erb’s actions gave the Coalition Force a brief window of opportunity for success and equated to a hindering loss of enemy assets.</p>

<p>First Lieutenant Anderson, Platoon Leader for the Mike Infantry Platoon Quotes:</p>

<blockquote>"Alpha was too deep into their reconnaissance mission to provide any assistance for the capture of 127 and Bravo was in contact during their screening of the right flank. This left the 12 man element from the 2nd MRB and the 16 or 17 man element from the 29th ID as the only people capable of securing 127. We thought it would be a bloody fight and it certainly was. Between enemy air, tank, and infantry the position seemed to be unsecurable.<br />
<br />
Upon reaching the base of the hill the 2nd MRB element met stiff resistance resulting in CQC combat some of which from less than 30 meters. Their only relief was the 29th ID element coming in from the left but they were continuously plagued by air threats.We started to insert reinforcements via helicopter into the AO but an enemy MBT appeared on the hill top and began shelling Platoon HQ and the reinforcements as we were trying to ferry men to the front. Without adequate AT and the enemy controlling the sky we could only sit and watch as the tank shelled us to oblivion. The only hope we had at that point was the few 29th ID packs we could see moving to the top of the hill, but we didn’t think we had the armament to destroy the tank.<br />
<br />
I was thankfully wrong and the tank went up in an explosion which we quickly learned was due to T/4 Erb’s demolition charges. The momentum for 127 shifted at this point and we were able to take that damn hill. I’d have to say if anything that was probably one of the best plays of the campaign.”</blockquote>

<p><br /></p>

<p>We hope we are not overstepping our bounds with this recommendation and that you find this to be considerable. In the eyes of the 2nd, T/4 Erb’s achievements in the battle are certainly commendable. We would like to again extend our thanks and appreciation to the members of the 29th ID who helped us in these last two fights.</p>

While everyone tries to represent the 29th in a positive light, you took it to a whole other level.  Great work, well deserved, and long time coming.<br />

                            <p>I could not have done that without my backup. They had a small dismount team that the other 29th members either killed quickly or moved through without alerting OPFOR.  The only reason I was able to disable the MBT was the rest of the 29th that covered my approach and calmly called out its position.  The beer is on me. Ever Forward!</p>
