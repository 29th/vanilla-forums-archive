<strong>He may not be the sharpest tool in the shed, but he sure is the biggest.</strong> </div>

<p></p><div style="text-align: center;">The Times. Just times that we had. <br />
"Good or Bad?" <br />
<strong><em>Yes.</em></strong> </div>

<p><strong>A few facts you may not have known about our friend Lev</strong> <strong>- <br />
1.</strong> Casually enjoys Crystal Meth non stop.<br />
<strong>2.</strong> Says he doesn't know what a Dutch Oven is, when he totally does. Stop lying, and admit to your vices. <br />
<strong>3.</strong> Is taller than you'd expect, but not like "Oh wow" tall. Kinda like, "I mean if he had flat footwear on you couldn't even tell." tall. So probably around 5'11 or so. Which I know, it's not even really "Tall" but it's still a good 3-4 inches above the National Average, so it isn't exactly <em>Not-Tall</em>. Especially if you live in the Maritimes, where everyone is even shorter because they're malnourished and depressed. I mean, I'm only a few inches taller than Lev and I walk around those parts and people look at me like I'm some sort of Ubermensch, when in actual fact I'm a sad lonely boy without any redeemable qualities. <br />
<strong>4.</strong> Can't eat toast on account of his "Severe Palette Moisture".</p>

<p>I know some of you may be like, "Wait a minute, how can a guy who smokes Meth be such a mean dude sometimes?". Well, to answer your question simplistically, Meth is an Amphetamine, and basically that'll get you all jacked to shit. It explains why Florida Man keeps flipping over police cars, and how he can chuck a stray cat from Miami Beach and hit the Bahamas. For a more complex answer, though, it boils down to you having to stop being such a soft fluffy piece of garbage, and learn to go hard in the paint. Stop shooting threes, stop dribbling away from contact. Just get down on the block, hold that ball high and away, pin your man with the booty, and back it up like you in the club and they started blaring Future. (Unless it's Codeine Crazy, that song depressing as all hell. Like why you gotta go harshin my mellow like that, dog?)</p>

<p>If you're lucky, the last thing you'll get to say to a person is a reflection of how you really feel about them. Whether or not the last time we've spoken has already passed, or the last direct communication shared is these very words, I feel a sense of obligation to that belief. So in the spirit of it I'd definitely like to say something.</p>

<p>So, Here's the thing, actually giving a damn makes up for a plethora of sins. Being principled is a virtue uncompromised by attitude or mannerism. Integrity outweighs stubbornness; passion isn't devalued by being contrarian, and if you stop for a moment to appreciate the broader spectrum, you'll find that dedication and selflessness flow freely through the veins of those not bothering to stop to have their altruism adored, appreciated, or even acknowledged. Say what you will about how that may manifest in appearance, in function it is a personality rendered invaluable. A worth of which can hardly be measured because without that very contribution the structures capable of measuring its value cease to exist.</p>

<p><strong>To my Friend Lev</strong>,</p>

<p>I've grown a lot alongside ya'll folks of the 29th. Among, and along with, men and women I've come to admire more than some in my regular life. Wisdom and kindness shared in abundance by Adults and the young alike. People I've looked up to, equals with whom I could relate, and friends to confide within. But of the thousands there was only ever one parity. An unparalleled one that was so damn similar it couldn't help but irritate to frustration. Clashes were inevitable, frequent, sometimes mean-spirited, and admittedly not always productive. Except when they were... And when they were? Structures and elements born out of those late night arguments still stand now, 4, 5, 6 years later. Infrastructure and frameworks bred out of fiery disagreement, quelled only by the slow but eventual acceptance of a wary compromise, form the bedrock for much of the foundation upon which we all currently stand.</p>

<p>Lev, as far as I'm concerned, in this community you've been a pillar without peer. A display of dedication and excellence that has been, without exaggeration, awe-inspiring to witness. At times mirroring a puppeteer, with this your marionette. A hand in all things. Directing, guiding, and building. An influence spread about like the veins of a circulatory system, carrying life to and through all anatomy. Power corrupts, we all know this, but when those of great talent posses that simple moral courage to admit when they're at fault, well then that reassurance does more to quell worries of the Dictatorship. It reveals benevolence, and earns faith. You've paid that faith back with a titanic contribution matched by no other. On behalf of our prosperity, I thank you for that.</p>

<p>I want to get personal for just a second. Bare with me.</p>

<p>What you'll find is that insofar as I consider personal value, all of what I mentioned is secondary. Virtually unimportant. For me, what matters most in a person is not how much they benefit the systems they work within, not the profit they can generate, or the power they accrue. What matters is the affect you have on others. That's what this being alive thing is all about anyway, isn't it? Disagree if you must, but for a moment entertain the idea that what's being said is tangible. In that truth your value to me exceeds that of which you've brought to the 29th. At first, Our arguments were a stumble for me, but through them I learned the value of my opinions, and the perceptions of competence and sense of integrity they brought. As the years went on and those arguments went from squabbles to point-counterpoint debates, I developed this weird emotional strength called confidence. But I felt it everywhere, not just in arguing over the internet with some nerd from 2 provinces over -- in the classroom, or at work, my sense of worth grew. Even to the point where it changed how I played basketball. I, a full grown man, in part owe my self-esteem and emotional maturity to the interactions I had with a person I've never met, clashing over how best to design structures for an organization that no one in my daily life can truly appreciate. You can measure how much better I am as a person for having been friends with you, Lev, and not only do I find that incredible, but it is of a worth to me valued incalculable. You've worn a hundred masks for the thousand different tasks asked of you, but beneath each has always been a great person. The type of person that makes this long journey a worthy one.</p>

<p>A great foe when you had to be, but nevertheless a friend the whole way through. If all that will ever be said between us is nearing to a close, just know that while the communication may cease I'm gonna keep on remembering you for the rest of my life, bud. <strong>Always and Ever Forward</strong>.</p>
