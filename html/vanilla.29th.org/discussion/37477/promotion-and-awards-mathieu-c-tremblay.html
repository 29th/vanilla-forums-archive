  <p>Three months ago <a rel="nofollow" href="http://personnel.29th.org/#members/89457">PFC Tremblay</a> was given his ASL spot, and since then Tremblay has shown us why he was right for that spot. Not only did he quickly show us that he was a natural born leader but, also that he was willing to work hard to perfect his chosen path here in the 29th. The big difference between PFC Tremblay and many others I see around here is that he was willing to admit and learn from his mistakes, no he isn't perfect but, he took every opportunity to learn all he could about being in leadership and, while there is always more to learn I have no doubt in mind that going forward Tremblay will go after any problem in front of him with the same enthusiasm and effort that he has shown throughout the last 3 months. So let me be the first to say congratulations on completing SLT Tremblay, but that's not the only thing we're here to celebrate today because, PFC is no longer a fitting title for Tremblay instead given his dedcation and hard work I think Cpl. Tremblay has a much better ring to it. Congrats Cpl. Tremblay you've done a great job so far keep it up!</p>

  <p>There has been a void in EP4S2 for quite awhile. The Assistant Squad Leader position has never been truly filled since our first ASL discharged. Ever since then, the position has been a revolving door and many people have been placed there in an attempt to fill the missing piece. These people weren't bad at their job; they were quite good however, leadership was just not for them. Now we are here with our 4th ASL, <a rel="nofollow" href="http://personnel.29th.org/#members/89457">PFC Tremblay</a>. He has been our ASL for three months and I can confidently say that he has filled the void that has been lingering in EP4S2. Ever since he stepped into the shoes as an ASL, our squad has started to improve tremendously. Attendance, performance, and morale have been at an all-time high for EP4S2. PFC Tremblay is a crucial factor in why we having been doing so well. Recently, I had to take a short ELOA to focus on some real-life issues. At first, I was worried that it would be too much for Tremblay to handle me not being there. Well, I was completely wrong about that. He handled everything perfectly while I was away. Throughout the week I was absent, he had to control the squad during all of the drills and even ran a platoon drill while I was away. For one week, that is a lot of work for one man to do. He did have some help from platoon HQ but, he still proved to be capable of running a squad by himself. Without him, EP4S2 wouldn’t be what it is today. I’m glad to have him as my ASL and can’t thank enough for his efforts. Therefore, we shall be rewarding him a Good Conduct Medal due to his great work these past few months.</p>
