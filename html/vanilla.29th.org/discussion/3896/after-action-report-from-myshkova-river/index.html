Soldiers of the 29th Infantry Division,
<br /><br />
Communication has arrived from the destroyed village of Myshkova of a brutal battle that took place over the river crossing on 24 May. It is with great pleasure to announce that the German attack has been repelled and we maintain control of the town!
<br /><br />
Intelligence had reported a sizable German force from the 5.SS Panzer-Division Finnisches Freiwilligen-Battalion were moving to to secure the river crossing over the Myshkova River. A small force from Able Company Third Platoon were sent to quickly defend Myshkova from the German attack while a more substantial defense could be mustered. AP3 laid in wait for the 5th SS FFB to arrive. Before they made it to Myshkova, Allied air power caused significant causalities to the German forces leading to a reduced German presence in the vicinity of Myshkova.
<br /><br />
For the first round, AP3 attempted to clear out the remain German presence in Myshkova. Though the opposition few, they maintained a formidable presence of three machine gun nests and several snipers spread throughout the village. Thankfully, AP3 only suffered one death as they successfully cleared the village from the German forces.
<br /><br />
The German commander outside of Myshkova saw that the remaining Germans inside Myshkova had been eliminated leading to an immediate counter attack through the village attempting to push AP3 out. With a larger force, the 5th SS FFB attempted to cross the river and eliminate the allied presence. AP3 set up a hasty line of defense along the river and waited for the German attack.
<br /><br />
German snipers set up positions outside of Myshkova and worked on taking out anybody they could target. Thankfully, some of the best rifles in the 29th were set up along the river and exchanged fire with these snipers, reducing the tactical advantage. The rest of the infantry from the 5th SS FFB made a strong push up to the opposite river bank, swarming the allied defense. Though most would have fallen back to stronger defensive positions in the face of this German assault, AP3 stood firm at the river bank! AP3 was able to hold the river and prevented a German occupation of Myshkova for the rest of the day. With darkness falling on the village, the German forces pulled out of Myshkova leaving AP3 in uncontested control over the Myshkova River!
<br /><br />
For their valiant efforts against the German opposition, I proudly award the following to those who fought in Myshkova and supported the opposition:

Although Private Kyle R. Layland and Private, First Class Christian D. Robles were not on the roster, they showed up to almost every single practice whether it was voluntary or required. They threw in their two cents on our plans and when called upon, they both acted very responsible and helped their platoon to secure the victory by preparing them day in and day out. For their actions, they are being awarded the Good Conduct Medal.
