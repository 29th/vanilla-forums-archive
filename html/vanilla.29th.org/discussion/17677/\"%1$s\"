                    <p>I'd like to say I know exactly how to start this, but I honestly don't. I don't even completely know how to wrap my head around this. A decade of time spent on people I have never met, and largely will never meet. Thousands of hours dedicated to this crazy community of people who pretend we're soldiers. How the hell has it been ten years...</p>

<p>I enlisted what seems a lifetime ago in October of 2006. My brother had joined a realism unit that folded after about two weeks and the concept seemed interesting to me. I joined a random populated server that had a realism unit looking name, figured out their website, and enlisted. By random chance, I had stumbled across one of the greatest experiences of my life. We had two platoons with about 8 guys in each of our 5 squads. At around 50 members, we were one of the largest realism units in Day of Defeat. Within a year, we had 4 platoons and 110 members.</p>

<p>To a much younger me, the 29th seemed like a good opportunity to goof off in a slightly more structured way. Had I been told in those first few months that I would eventually sit where SSgt. Shore in Platoon HQ was, I would have laughed at you. If you said I would end up where FSgt. Reyes and FSgt. Caruso sat in Company HQ, or that one day I would be in a rank and position we hadn't even invented yet, I probably would have left and never come back. Young Conrad wasn't one for responsibility and he never would be as far as he was concerned. Yet here I am.</p>

<p>Had I not retired after a year and a half, I might have been celebrating my 10 and a half years this month instead. I think it more likely that I wouldn't be celebrating anything at all if I hadn't left. In the six months I was away from the unit, I missed it desperately. I worried if I would still fit when I came back, if the unit would be there at all, but I had higher responsibilities. I started playing World of Warcraft in 2008 and that was much more important than some silly old shooter. A few months later I realized that my start-up/shut-down chain of guilds was an attempt to grasp at leadership, trying to take on responsibilities. Shocking as this interest in responsibility was to me, I realized I already had somewhere to devote that energy. I went back to the 29th, expecting to claw my way up to leadership, no matter what it took.</p>

<p>Instead I found myself welcomed back with open arms and a Squad Leader position open for my taking, the new frontier of Darkest Hour on the horizon. My return to the unit is when I realized for the first time that the 29th wasn't just a bunch of kids playing soldiers; some of us were family. In missing the 29th, I had come to respect and love what it was that I had missed out on for too long. Then I had a few people I considered very close friends. Now I still have close friends in the unit, but I legitimately call some of you my family. I've known many of you longer than people I know in my daily life.</p>

<p>After that, my story is just a blur of history and work. I took over CP1, eventually moved up to Charlie HQ as a First Sergeant, took a step away during college in the Reserves but never could bring myself to just resign, came back to AP2 as a Sergeant, and clawed my way back up to First Sergeant in Able HQ, and that was the end of the story for me. The Battalion NCO spot was occupied by my eternal rival, the now T3 Hart. There was no way that spot was going to open up, so I made myself comfortable.</p>

<p>And now I'm the Master Sergeant. I realize as I'm writing this I'm actually coming up on a year of time in this position, which seems far too long and has gone by far too quickly. It's always still surprising when people trip over themselves when I enter a channel or join a server. To be treated as an object of awe and reverence is something I never anticipated, though I admit the feeling is nice. I look at those Privates and PFCs that stare up at me with a fire in their eyes and see myself from that decade ago. Every time I hear an argument against someone leading or taking a position because they're too new, I remember that once we were all too new and someone gave us a chance anyways. I always root for the little guy because who knows where they'll be two years, five years, ten years down the road. When I need to be aggressive and I put someone through the grinder, I do so knowing that criticism grows and sometimes things must be destroyed to allow something new to be made in its place (though sometimes I do indeed enjoy being a bastard). I've yelled at a lot of people that now run offices, squads, platoons, and even companies. I've fostered the next generation of the 29th and watched them grow and join me in fostering the new 'next generation'.</p>

<p>And I can't wait to see what's coming next.</p>

<p>I celebrate with you all, the members of the 29th, my 10th year of service in the 29th, my 20th AOCC, and my 5th WWI Victory Medal.<br />

<p>P.S. If you made it this far, you have a weapons pass until the end of the day Sunday. We totally forgot to celebrate the 29th's birthday, so here's your present hidden under a wall of text.</p>

                            <p>10 years and still hasn't learned you don't post your own awards. :P</p>

<p>Congratulations and thank you for your decade long service MSgt, quite the ride I imagine, do you think you can reach 2 decades? Quintuple rainbow club doesn't sound cool though so you'll just have to settle for <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Guard">old grumbler</a>.</p>

                            <p>Wow, that is a long time. Seeing dedication like this gives me confidence to the longevity of the 29th IMO. Other units seem to try but end up falling apart and throwing in the towel. Strong, dedicated leadership stood out immediately to me when I first joined. I am sure I speak for most junior NCO's in saying you are an inspiration to us. Great work and congratulations.</p>
