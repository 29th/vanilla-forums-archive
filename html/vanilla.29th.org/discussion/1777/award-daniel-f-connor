  <p>Sgt. Ternby said:<br />During the first round of the company drill (15th February), on the map Englesqueville, PFC Connor’s squad (who were on Axis) was tasked with defending the buildings on the far west of the map. This particular area had huge open grounds, covered by hedgerows making it a perfect place for the enemies to flank, and so they did. Realising the potential threat, PFC Pike ordered PFC Connor, together with two squadmates to set up on the west and act as a scouting team. During the first 5 minutes of the round, the allies had sent up 2 whole squads over to the west, towards the very position that the scouting team was set up in and when their position got stormed, the PFC decided to stay at a safe distance, while taking as many of the allies down as possible. Here, he managed to get 1 grenade kill, as well as two long range kar 98 kills.</p>
</div></blockquote>

<p>The overall confusion in the enemy squads, caused by the scouting team also resulted in an enemy tk. After losing the two squad members who were set up with him, the PFC realized that the enemies would eventually overwhelm him, and therefore decided to fall back towards the buildings his squad was tasked with defending. Setting up in the top floor, he managed to take down yet another 3 enemies (at long distance) with his rifle, killing enemies who were moving towards his position. After closing in on the building the PFC had set up in, an enemy soldier armed with a light managed to clear it all out, with the exception of PFC Connors position. He cleverly hid in a corner of a room on the top floor and when the light stormed his position, he was shot dead before he could react. Realizing that there were now several more enemies in his building, the PFC decided to do a bold move and assault the enemies that were still downstairs with his last grenade. The bold move proved effective, and with this grenade, PFC Connor got another 2 kills. At his point, he had gotten 9 kills in total. Right after the grenade was thrown, an enemy tank hunter had been informed of the PFC's whereabouts and with a well placed zook rocket on the building, PFC Connor went down, ending his killing spree at 9. During this round, the PFC displayed great skill with both his rifle and his grenades, as well as showing a superb overall awareness of his surroundings. The reason he managed to get as many kills as he did, was because of his quick thinking, him being constantly on the move, and the way he managed to outsmart his enemies. His actions severely slowed down the enemy attack and while his squad didn't manage to hold the Buildings which they were defending, the actions of the PFC helped reducing the enemies numbers enough, to ensure that they could not advance any further, eventually resulting in a victory for his team</p>

<p>HQ is happy to award PFC Connor the Bronze Star Medal! Congratulations PFC!</p>
