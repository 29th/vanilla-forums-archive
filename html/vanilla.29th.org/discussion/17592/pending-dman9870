                            <p>T/5 Garrett means that it will be reviewed in 24 to 48 hours, which is my job.</p>

<p>And seeing how anxious you are to know if you will be unbanned or not, I will give you a solid "No".</p>

<p>You've been banned three times on our servers in the past.  We've given you a chance to mature up and stop trolling, to play the game and to learn to follow our basic server rules.  Seeing that you are incapable of doing that, your ban will remain permanent.</p>
