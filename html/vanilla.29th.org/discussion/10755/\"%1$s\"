<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">
  <p><a rel="nofollow" href="http://personnel.29th.org/#members/12659">PFC Egelund</a> is a real veteran of the 29th, not only because of the long time he's been here, but also because of all of the different things he's been doing all around the unit during his time here. He's been in SLT, becoming the ASL of DP2S2, BP1S3 and BP1S1. After that he transfered for a while to AP1S1 as a rifleman, Before he had to go to the reserves due to the lack of time. Luckily for us, the PFC decided to return to BP1S1 once he found the time to rejoin the 29th and has, except for a 5 month break, been here since. The PFC has not only had leadership roles within the 29th, but has had a countless amount of jobs. Back in 2012, the then Pvt. Egelund decided to become an enlistmen liason for the lighthouse Corps, and has since then had the following jobs, bear with me here, operations planner in the Operations Corps, journalist in the Civil Affairs Corps, submachine gun school cadre for the Advanced Infantry Training Corps, Project assistant in the operations Corps, Chief of Civil Affairs Corps, Assistant Chief Finance Officer within the Finance Corps, AWOL Adjutant in the Adjutant Corps, and finally Chief of Medical Corps. With a resume like this it's easy to see why he's one of those guys who's just fundamental for the 29th, in order to make it all run. Alot of the times, alot of it is done behind the scenes, but it's important to appreciate the great work that people like PFC Egelund put in to make the 29th run and the PFC has been doing an excellent job at what he's been doing.</p>
</div></blockquote>

<p>But there's more. Not only has the PFC excelled at leading and doing all the different jobs he's had, he's also a really skilled DH player. Back in 2012, I assigned him to be the SMG:er of DP2S1, and it didn't take long Before he got reaally good with the AIT. Like I mentioned earlier he even taught out how to use the AIT at classes within the 29th and he really mastered the AIT like no one I've seen Before or since. When he came back to my squad in 2015, he decided to pick up the MG and just like with the light, he quickly became reaaally good with it and is getting Close to his 3rd Sharpshooter Badge. To summarize, PFC Egelund is one of those guys who's great at alot of different things, and he's really shown that in his career in the 29th, in his countless amounts of jobs, in his leading, and in his skills with his AIT's. He's also a really great guy to be around, and I'm glad to have been in the same squad as him for as long as I have. The PFC has now been in the 29th for a total of 3 and a half years, and is therefore eligible for his 7th AOCC, just 6 more months until you get the double Rainbow!</p>

<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">
  <p>Also PFC Egelund has been all around the 29th in the 3 years and 6 months he's been here and has been Everything from a light AIT:er to a MG AIT:er to an ASL in both DH and Rising storm and the really astounding rifle skills of this particular PFC being one of them. At drills, especially squad drills, PFC Egelund is really one to fear and it's not uncommon that he during squad drills eliminates pretty much the entire enemy team, several rounds in a row. He's got dead-on accuracy, something that we acknowledged pretty long ago when we gave him all his ticks for the rifle Sharpshooter Badge. This was all the way back in 2014, and while all the ticks had been ticked, he never actually received his Sharpshooter Badge. I'm ashamed to say that since the PFC has by far completed Everything needed for a Sharpshooter Badge and could in my opinion even get Close to a few of the expert ticks. Well, it's now time to give PFC Egelund his "fairly" overdue Award, finally acknowledging his great skill with the rifle. Congrats PFC!</p>
