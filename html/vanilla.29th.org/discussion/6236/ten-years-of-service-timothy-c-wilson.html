                    <p>Where were you ten years ago?  For many in the unit, you were still in grammar school, for me, I had just graduated high school and was getting ready to start college.  For Cpt. Wilson, he was enlisting into the greatest gaming organization in the history of gaming organizations (I may be biased but I stand by it).  The 29th then wasn't what it was now, we had a single Company, no senior NCO's, and lacked a solid foundation to stand on.  Cpt. Wilson quickly rose through the ranks and soon was sitting in the driver's seat and moving the Company forward.  When I joined BCT in late 2006, I quickly recognized how much impact Cpt. Wilson had on the gaming community as a whole.  Many of you may not know this but Cpt. Wilson was once awarded a medal from a German realism unit for his efforts in quelling an argument between the community and helping the community to move forward together.</p>

<p>For this post, I didn't want to give the standard discussion of what tasks he completed and what positions Cpt. Wilson held because I didn't feel it would do him justice.  Cpt. Wilson was more than just the unit commander, he was and still is a mentor to the leadership of the unit.  Through his original SLT video, he still gives his advice on how to be a squad leader, though it's been changed a few times, the core of Officer Candidate School is structured off of his original teachings, and he's been there for me on countless occasions where I felt it was time to throw in the towel.  I asked Cpt. Cooke to say a few words about Cpt. Wilson:</p>

<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">
  <p>Cpt. Wilson has been a friend and a mentor for me. I've known him since December 2006, but it wasn't until the summer of 2007 that I was really able to begin working closely with him. He was a fantastic feedback partner for me as I developed ideas for 29th Offices and beyond. He was never afraid to tell me that an idea was bad, but he also supported my ideas by giving me the time and space to let a little creativity flow. This is something that has continued to be valuable to me in my personal and professional life as I will never forget the importance of a little trust and room to fail.</p>
  
  <p>As an officer, Cpt. Wilson continued to help mentor me and develop me as a leader both in the 29th and in real life. He continually challenged me and offered new ways to learn, both through readings and anecdoctal examples to make me better and better. He always let me experiment, even if it meant failure, then worked with me to show how I could be better.</p>
  
  <p>The 29th ID is the greatest gaming organization online, and it wouldn't exist if it wasn't for Cpt. Wilson. I will be forever grateful for what he has done both for me personally, and for the work he has done to allow my continued participation in this great unit. 10 years of service is something incredible, and I'm glad to be here to be able to thank him.</p>
  
  <p>Cpt. Wilson: Thank you for everything. You're a fantastic leader and mentor. Your work and efforts for the 29th ID will never be forgotten!</p>
</div></blockquote>

<p>I would like to repeat the sentiment from Cpt. Cooke, we definitely would not be where we are today without the efforts of Cpt. Wilson.  I personally thank Cpt. Wilson and it is my extreme honor and privilege to award Cpt. Timothy C. Wilson with his <em><strong>TWENTIETH</strong></em> Army of Occupation Medal and <strong><em>FIFTH</em></strong> World War I Victory Medal for Ten Years of Service to the 29th Infantry Division!  In recognition of this, Cpt. Cooke and myself have arranged for a surprise to be delivered to Cpt. Wilson today, after he receives it, I'll announce the surprise.  Thanks again, Captain, the unit appreciates everything you've done.</p>

                            <p>Holy cow. Feels like just yesterday that I passed SSgt. Glackin's basic training on dod_kalt. Lt. Colonel, Captain, thank you for taking the time to put that together. It really means a lot. And thank you everyone else for your kind words. It's been a pleasure to work with you guys and see everyone grow and grow with you. I have no idea what this "surprise" is but I hope my neighbors don't start looking at me funny :P</p>

<p>And thanks for the challenge <a href="/profile/PFC%20Warner" rel="nofollow">@PFC Warner</a></p>
