<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4a/FNL_Flag.svg/1200px-FNL_Flag.svg.png" width="45%" alt="image" /></div>

<p><br /><br />
<span style="font-size: medium; font-family: Verdana;">The National Liberation Front of Southern Vietnam, nicknamed by their adversaries "Viet Cong", was one of the main combatants of the Vietnam War, making it a unique piece of the conflict through its extensive use of guerilla warfare, nighttime operations, and infiltration. First declared a sovereign group in the later part of 1960 while the war had already been raging for years, the fighting elements of what would eventually become the NLF were already present in South Vietnam years earlier.</span></p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/lbiTOPw.png" width="45%" alt="A tour guide showing an entrance to a Viet Cong tunner" style="float: right; margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 30px; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;" /></p>

<p><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: Verdana;">The Viet Cong's guerrilla tactics, complex tunnel systems, the operations they took part in, and appreciation of nature are often points of discussion when considering their participation in the hostilities. However, there are some aspects of the National Liberation Front which are rarely touched upon; the context of their creation and their fate once the war was over and Vietnam was reunited.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><b>Birth of the Liberation Front</b></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: Verdana;">Failed military coups, peasant uprisings, and armed religious sects in the years leading to 1960 were already doing much to destabilize South Vietnam. While some of these groups were successful in dismantling the presence of the government's police and military within the regions they had surged in, the lack of support and no steady supply line meant it was a matter of time before they had to abandon their newly obtained territory and go underground again to avoid direct conflict with the Army of the Republic.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: Verdana;">The National Liberation Front was created to centralize these many insurgent groups within South Vietnam, and not only aid them with the supplies that came from North Vietnam through the Ho Chi Minh Trail but also guide them on military campaigns. These groups were varied in origin, their background, members, the nature of their dissent, their ethnicity, religious beliefs, and even their plans for Vietnam if it were to be once again united. The main groups were those who had suffered direct suppression by South Vietnam's government and some of those who had already supported Vietnam against France during the First Indochina War. <img src="https://i.imgur.com/dFmP8X9.png" width="40%" alt="Ho Chi Minh trail" style="float: left; margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 30px; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;" />Political groups, religious sects, and other social organizations, many of which had already clashed with South Vietnam's secret police force, were the groups that formed the political parties that would, in 1960, form a Central Committee and unite these groups into one organization. The newly formed NLF would soon carry on to join North Vietnam against the Southern forces, now relying on supplies coming from the North through the Ho Chi Minh trail.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: Verdana;">Before the First Indochina War, the Ho Chi Minh trail was an unnamed, unrefined trade line that had been in use in the region for centuries, but had since been improved for military use during wartime. By 1959, one year before the proper creation of the NLF, the People's Army of North Vietnam 559th Transportation Group had already been tasked with maintaining and improving the trail to supply insurgents within South Vietnam, turning it into the network of supply lines that would be vital to the NLF's success, transporting tonnes of supplies and thousands of men to the south.<img src="https://i.imgur.com/NwraY62.png" alt="National Liberation Front soldiers" width="35%" style="float: right; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 30px;" /></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: Verdana;">The National Liberation Front of Southern Vietnam, what had once been a variety of motivated but fickle and undersupplied insurgent groups within South Vietnam's borders, now was a centralized group, with an intricate supply line providing them with much-needed resources coming from North Vietnam. The Viet Cong was now prepared to make their debut on the battlefields of the Vietnam War.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><b>Victory and Defeat in the South</b></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: Verdana;">As the war continued, in June 1969 the political leadership of the NLF formed the Provisional Revolutionary Government of the Republic of South Vietnam, with the intent of helping the Viet Cong obtain international stature. The PRG was formed from the political entities already within the Front, and other south Vietnamese political elements supportive of their cause. Their declared intent was to advance the interests of the South Vietnamese people and provide the Liberation Front with a governmental structure. Settled near the Cambodian border, the PRG initiated organizing its negotiations for eventual reunification. However, after the US and South Vietnamese forces launched the Cambodian campaign, the PRG suffered losses, and the replacements sent from North Vietnam were clashing with the more neutral parties, causing political turmoil within the PRG ranks. When complaints sent to the North Vietnamese government were dismissed, it became clear to NLF and PRG leadership that the nationalists and less revolutionary volunteers who once united to create the Liberation Front were now being cast aside in favor of those determined on advancing North Vietnam's interests.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: Verdana;">The military organization of the Front was similar to its political segment, as the NLF forces suffered casualties, they were replenished by North Vietnamese men, steadily replacing the southerners within the military organization. This reached a peak after the Tet Offensive where, by the estimation of the PAVN and Viet Cong, forty thousand Viet Cong were killed, with more than sixty thousand being injured.<img src="https://i.imgur.com/1O7AA9l.png" width="40%" alt="A youth representative of the PRG at the 1973 World Youth Conference in Berlin" style="float: left; margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 30px; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;" /> NLF leaders noted that units that were once dominated by southerners had been replaced by northerners years before the fall of Saigon. This solidifies the loss of unity inside the groups that were created within the borders of South Vietnam, intending to extend the interests of the South Vietnamese people against a government they believed was ruling not for its people.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: Verdana;">After the fall of Saigon on the 30th of April 1975, the Provisional Government of the Republic of South Vietnam assumed power in the South and participated in the reunification of Vietnam. The North Vietnamese leadership swiftly decided to dissolve the PRG after the reunification was completed. North and South now merged into the Socialist Republic of Vietnam in July 1976, the PRG was dissolved, and the National Liberation Front soon followed a comparable fate, being merged with the Vietnamese Fatherland Front in February 1977.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: Verdana;">The National Liberation Front of Southern Vietnam succeeded in its fight against the South Vietnamese government and their American allies, but the southern nationalists were replaced by men from the north as the war went on. This would eventually be the main cause of North Vietnam having sole authority over the now reunified nation.</span></p>
