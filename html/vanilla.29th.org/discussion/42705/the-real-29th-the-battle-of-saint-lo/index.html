<p></p><div style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/3P4OVoc.jpg" width="55%" alt="image" style="margin-top: 30px; margin-bottom: 30px;" /></div>

<p><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: Verdana;">Most people exposed to Anglophone media know about the Normandy landings (Operation Neptune), in which the 29th Infantry Division (ID) took part. People living in the early 21st century know of the famous movies such as “Saving Private Ryan” which depicted the landings of the 29th at Omaha beach. On June 6, 1944, the 116th "Ever Forward" Regiment of the 29th ID, was indeed assigned to the first wave on four sectors of Omaha, intended to support the 1st Infantry Division “Big Red One”. Of it’s 3100 men, the 116th Regiment took 900 casualties. By the 7th of June, the rest of the 29th had landed and by the 9th, Omaha Beach was secure and the division took Insigny-sur-mer. However, few know of the subsequent battles the 29th fought after Normandy, unless you actually read about it or if you played Company of Heroes 1. This article serves as a brief account of the 29th taking Saint-Lô in July 1944.</span></p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/xaHJSWT.png" alt="Disposition of Forces in June 1944. 29th is with the First Army just NE of St.Lo." width="45%" style="float: right; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 30px;" /></p>

<p><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><b>THE 29th ID AFTER D-DAY IN JUNE 1944</b></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: Verdana;">In the middle of 1944, the 29th ID was composed of 3 infantry regiments (115th, 116th, 175th), supported by 4 Field Artillery Battalions (105mm guns), and one support battalion each of combat engineers, medical, mechanized reconnaissance, signals, and others. This was the standard organization for non-elite U.S army divisions. By late June, the 29th ID’s effective strength was around 12,000, since it had suffered more than 1000 casualties on D-Day and was considered understrength. However, after two weeks of reorganization and regroup, on July 14th, the 29th Division was reassigned to XIX Corps (also consisting the 30th ID and 35th ID) with the task of leading the assault towards Saint-Lô. Located roughly 25 miles to the Southwest of Omaha, the division began its march along the hedgerow filled terrain to the city.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><b>THE STRATEGIC OBJECTIVE OF SAINT-LÔ</b></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: Verdana;">Saint-Lô was a large strategic objective, chosen alongside Carentan and Caen by SHAEF (Supreme Headquarters, Allied Expeditionary Force) for obvious reasons. With a population of 11,000, Saint-Lô sat on low ground surrounded by hills, with large arterial roads that connected it to other major ports and roads towards Bayeux, an important staging ground for the allied push further into France and Belgium. Since D-Day, St-Lô had already been under heavy allied bombing which destroyed most of the city and dispersed the local population (with an unknown number of civilian casualties). <img src="https://i.imgur.com/oI0gD8K.png" width="55%" alt="29th Division’s position towards St-Lô with 115th and 116th regiments leading the assault" style="float: left; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 30px;" /> This bombing campaign was to prevent German supplies and reinforcements from moving into the allied invasion zone by rail or road. The ground offensive for St. Lô was planned in late June and involved 12 Allied divisions in 4 Corps on a 12 mile front, against a hodgepodge of German troops that retreated from Normandy, as well as fresh elite troops that were stationed deeper in Normandy. The Divisional Commander of the 29th ID, Maj.Gen Gerhardt, was assigned a sector stretching a few miles. Directly facing the 29th and guarding the town and surrounding area were elements of the 352. Infanterie Division and the elite 3. Fallschirmjägerdivision (3. FSJg). In all, an estimated 10-15,000 German troops were in the AO, but the actual number remains unknown.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><b>THE 116TH AND THE BOCAGES</b></span></p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/MLi6iXy.jpg" width="48%" alt="image" style="float: right; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 30px;" /></p>

<p><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: Verdana;">On July 11th, the 29th was given orders to commence the attack. P-47 Thunderbolts were called to strafe the hedgerows surrounding the city. 1st Battalion of 116th (our unit’s real life counterpart) was surrounded as it had unwittingly crossed too far ahead, and had become encircled for 2 days before being relieved by elements of the 115th. This mishap led to numerous friendly fire incidents from aerial bombardment, resulting in more than 100 casualties for the 116th. Strategic locations such as hills and river crossings were pre-marked by German artillery and continuously bombarded.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><b>THE 3. FALLSCHIRMJÄGERDIVISION</b></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: Verdana;">Both German and American sources indicate clearly that it was the 3.FSJg that inflicted the most casualties on the 29th at St-Lô. 29th Veterans noted that the 3.FSJg preferred to attack suddenly at night and from all sides. 1/115th received a night attack which its commander described as “beautifully executed and planned”; a barrage of precise 88mm, Nebelwerfer and 105mm shells which led to its outposts becoming overrun. This parachute unit was veteran and composed entirely of very young volunteers. They had gone through the most intense training the Luftwaffe had to offer, and had previously fought at Crete in 1941. Moreover, it was much better equipped than the soldiers of the 29th. Along with SS Panzer detachments, it was much more heavily equipped, had more mortars, and was 30% larger than the 29th ID. Each company in the 3.FSJg had 20 machineguns and 43 SMGs, but each company in the 29th ID only had 2 .30 cal guns and 9 BARs. Knowing that St-Lô was being bombarded, it had entrenched itself over the hedgerows in a wide area. They also mined the entirety of the roads facing the 29th and camouflaged StuG IIIs in ditches, making them almost invulnerable to aerial attack. One battalion commander of the 29th said: "Those Germans are the best damned soldiers I ever saw. They're smart and they don't know what 'fear' means. They come in and they keep coming until they get their job done or you kill 'em."</span></p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/VIbJ5xq.png" width="55%" alt="German Fallschrimjager at St-Lô" style="float: right; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 30px;" /></p>

<p><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: Verdana;">From July 17th, it was clear to XIX Corps HQ that the 29th had become bogged down in the hedgerows due to the terrain of Normandy and the elite German troops, and famously lost one battalion commander from mortar fire; Major Thomas Howie. Major General Gerhardt, the divisional commander, famously put Major Howie’s flag draped body on a jeep and drove into the city, calling the dead Major “the Major of St-Lô”. On the 17th, the 29th entered St-Lô in force and witnessed a destroyed city with Germans entrenched in urban terrain, facing snipers and mines which heavily slowed the advance and resorted the commander to call aerial bombing to level the city. As such, the city was virtually destroyed. By July 19th, the city had been taken by the 29th, but not before the division tallied a very high amount of casualties- twice as much as the 82nd or 101st Airborne Division. At this point, the 116th regiment alone had suffered 2516 casualties since June 7th (the regiment had landed on D-Day with 3100 men), while the total losses of the division amounted to 3706. Due to the incredibly high amount of casualties, on July 20th, the 29th was called back to the reserve line and replaced by the 35th ID.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><b>THE 29th AFTER ST-LÔ</b></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: Verdana;">After St-Lô, the 29th was relieved and redeployed to Vire, capturing the city by August 7th during Operation Cobra (an armor led assault deep into France to encircle the Germans). It was then assigned to Brest, and later took part in the invasion of the Ruhr area of Germany. The 29th ID was famous not only because of the Normandy landings, but also because it had a relatively high casualty rate (20,600 casualties) from June 1944 to May 1945 (more than 200% of its strength in just 242 days of combat). From the episode of St-Lô, it is clear that the 29th was neither ready nor well-equipped to face the elite 3.FSJg, but nevertheless got the job done due to numerous other units in the operation as well as armor and air support. Some historians have blamed the unit’s commander, Gerhardt for recklessness which led to demoralization in the unit, but that shall be covered in another story.</span></p>

                            <p>Thank you for this article! I really enjoyed the read! Those hedgerows must have been a nightmare for the allied troops.<br />
I wanna add a few things. I know this is not very important, but hey, its covid time and I´m sitting at home being bored! <img class="emoji" src="../../resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D" alt=":D" height="20" /> <br />
The 3rd Fallschrimjägerdivision was not composed entirely out of young volunteers. Instead it was composed of volunteers of the Luftwaffe Field Divisions ( which were weak ad-hoc units that mostly appeared on the eastern front. They were composed of Luftwaffe ground units with little to no combat experience ) and training units. It was more of a mixture of young volunteers and veterans with combat experience. <br />
The 3rd did not exist in 1941, and almost every german Fallschirmjäger that fought on crete in 1941 was either dead, wounded or captured by 1944. Most of those fighting at St Lo had combat experience from the eastern front or Italy. (Keep in mind that most Fallschirmjäger units fought on the eastern front and later in Italy previous to normandy and they have had high casualties over the time). <br />
No question the 29th had a very tough opponent with a lot of very good equipment ( 43 smg in a german company was ridiculously high, the standart was about 20 or even less) and the best training. By then, the german military training was very different from before the war. It was much less drill and much closer to real combat scenarios like it is today.  Eg., every german soldier who was awarded the Nahkampfspange in Gold, which meant having survived 50(!) full days in close combat, was send back home to train recruits for some time and pass on their knowledge. Indeed Fallschirmjäger were elite units and a tough nut to crack on all fronts. <br />
I really compliment the 29th for getting the job done as well as I compliment the Fallschirmjäger for holding down the fort for quiet some time against an overwhelming enemy (air)force. But in the end, I´m glad they lost. It was necessary to let others free Europe from Hitler.<br />
And if you ever need translation from german sources, holler at me. I´m always glad to help.<br />
Ever forward! PFC Spencer</p>

                            <p>Thank you Spencer,</p>

<p>I took the information from a number of references which were omitted in final version.  I did use a few german sources but majority English sources. I relied alot from historian Joseph Balkoski,JH Ewing and U.S army history library. for the information in German on 3fjg I used this important source <em>;Schimpf, Richard; Dewey Janet E (1989). Fighting of the 3rd Parachute Division during the invasion of France from June to August 1944.'</em> which was by the divisional commander Majorgeneral Schimpf and Historian Janet Dewey. The English translations of german , as well as included assessments of german troops by americans at the time might lead to potential inaccuracy. I guess American/British accounts of german units need to taken with extra rigour.</p>
