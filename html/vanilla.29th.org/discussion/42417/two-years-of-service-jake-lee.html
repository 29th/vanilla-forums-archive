<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">
  <p>In order to somewhat comprehensively cover the extensive influence that <a rel="nofollow" href="http://personnel.29th.org/#members/88646">Cpl. J. Lee</a> has had on the 29th, it is best to go back to when he joined DP2S1. Before he joined DP2S1, the squad was in a particularly rough spot. Attendance was at an all time low except for a few core members, morale was struggling, and the squad demonstrated several areas to improve in-game performance. But this began to change once Cpl. J. Lee joined the squad as its ASL. From practically the day he joined the squad as the ASL, Cpl. J. Lee worked constantly to improve his own leadership capabilities as well as the squad. His positive attitude, presence, and drive to improve the squad would be a major factor in the rise in squad attendance. First and foremost, Cpl. Lee would always maintain an approachable, hardworking, and friendly attitude, which many members of the squad would adopt as a model for how a member of the 29th should conduct themselves, including myself. This influence would continue as more and more people joined DP2S1, helping to create a new squad culture. Further down the road, once DP2S4 was created and DP2 experienced changes in leadership, Cpl. J. Lee was assigned as the newest SL in DP2S1. And since this assignment, the squad has only continued to improve. As of now, the squad is maintaining an attendance rate of over 90%, which has been in large part due to Cpl. Lee’s efforts. Furthermore, morale has remained consistently high since he was assigned SL, which he has undoubtedly contributed to thanks to his hard work and efforts as a squad leader. One of the most important parts of what has made Cpl. Lee such an important member of the 29th has been his consistent presence. Practically every day, he is on Teamspeak interacting and playing with other DP2S1 members and 29thers. The impact of Cpl. Lee maintaining such a presence cannot be understated, as this has directly contributed to maintaining and improving squad culture and squad morale. And by maintaining a presence outside of drills, Cpl. J. Lee has had a major impact on the improvement, motivations, and attitudes of the people inside and outside of DP2S1. Cpl. J. Lee’s contributions to the 29th don’t just stop in DP2S1, as he holds three other jobs outside of leadership! First off, he holds a job in Civil Affair Corps as the Editor in Chief, which is an important position in the staff office. Furthermore, Cpl. J. Lee serves as the Senior Enlistment Clerk for Lighthouse, where he has also made a significant impact in the office, such as when the Enlistment Liaison job was split in half and he had to retrain people with their different job responsibilities. And for his third and final job, Cpl. J. Lee serves as a member of Camera Crew, so that everyone can see his impressive displays of skill! Without Cpl. J. Lee and his work in these offices, it is very safe to say that they would be very different without him. Throughout his two year tenure in the 29th, Cpl. J. Lee has had a major impact on his squad and beyond. He continues to be one of the most knowledgeable and skilled players in the company, and was one of the biggest contributors to ironing out major problems in the squad, and he continues to serve as a model for how the members of DP2S1 should act. In conclusion, Cpl. J. Lee is one of the finest squad leaders in the 29th, an example for other members in the unit, and I am happy that of all the squads you were assigned to be the ASL, it was DP2S1. Congrats on your two years Cpl.!</p>
